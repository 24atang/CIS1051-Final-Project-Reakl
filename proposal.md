# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Attack on Mini Games

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A RenPy based visual story that draws on the anime Attack on Titan where the user has to solve certain puzzles/complete tasks to move through the story

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The Ren'Py software will create a visual novel that is my own interactive story. Some features it will have (though I have not decided what exactly) will be little games that are inspired by aspects of Attack on Titan that the user must complete to move on to the next part of the story. For instance, I was thinking of a game where you have to click parts of the ODM gear training structure when the program dictates. I am not sure if Attack on Titan's openings/endings/sounds are open for common use, but if not I might try to make my own sounds. The visual story will be executed with Ren'Py and underlying python programs for the games.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A visual story without any programs or music

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A visual story with programmed mini games/tasks

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A visual story with programmed mini games/tasks as well as my own created music

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, I need to watch tutorials on Ren'Py: how it works, how to add stuff, and how to create my own games in it. Next, I need to figure out what the games will be, and then I need to determine how to actually code the games I want, learning new skills along the way. Then, I need to learn how to combine everything (i.e put the games in Ren'Py)
